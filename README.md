# Thomas G. — Data & AI Systems Architect

Designing AI-native systems that treat **everything as an organization** and **every workflow as architecture**.

---

## 🎯 Current Mission

Build and deploy AI-native operating systems that help individuals, teams, and orgs:

- Navigate complexity
- Automate repeatable workflows
- Keep humans in the strategic loop

---

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- **AI Systems & Orchestration** – multi-model stacks, small + large model pairing, MCP ecosystems
- **Data & Analytics** – SQL, BI, workflow telemetry, decision support
- **Operational Design** – playbooks, runbooks, failure modes, and “ops lens” thinking

---

## 🚀 Flagship Project — The D.O.C. Project

The **Data Operations Center (D.O.C.)** is an open-source AI-native operating system that unifies intelligence across security, operations, business, and logistics using a modular, two-tier AI orchestration model.

- Two-tier AI model for cost-efficient intelligence  
- AI Gauntlet with trust & validation layers  
- Modular MCP integration for any data source  
- Compliance-aware and auditable by design  
- Scales from individual → enterprise → government

## 📚 Learning & Tooling Pipeline

Actively leveling up:

- **WGU** – Business / data & operations focused coursework
- **Data 365** – Applied data analyst paths
- **Coursera** – SQL for Data Analyst, BI, and workflow-focused courses

I treat each course as a **system component**:
- Inputs: concepts, labs, notes
- Outputs: repeatable workflows, playbooks, and portfolio artifacts

---

## 🧩 AEF-OS & Workflow Architecture

I also work on **AEF-OS (Adaptive Ethical Framework – Operating System)**:

- Everything-as-an-Organization (EAO) ontology  
- Task-as-Architecture: every task mapped as a node in a larger workflow graph  
- Drift tracking, observer personas, and controlled hallucination sandboxes  

This GitHub Pages site will eventually host:

- AEF-OS specs & diagrams  
- D.O.C. implementation notes  
- Playbooks and templates for real-world use
